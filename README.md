# task_tracker

### By Jed Chen
Simple Python GUI app made using Tkinter library

###
In order for the program to run, create a virtual environment folder and install the package in this folder. 
In order for the app to function properly, all of the files have to be directly in the virtual environment folder and not in the task_tracker-main folder. 

Secondly, install the "tkcalendar" module that provides a calendar widget. 
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the tkcalendar module using pip: pip install tkcalendar
 
3. There are also other necessary modules that needs to be installed. Those have all been installed inside the requirements.txt
